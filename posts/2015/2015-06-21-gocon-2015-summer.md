## Go Conference 2015 Summer

I participated in [Go Conference 2015 summer](http://gocon.connpass.com/event/14063/) as a speaker.

### Talks

I spoke about debugging go code using GDB. I would prefer not to recommend print debugging.
It should to build every modified code so we need to be familiar with GDB.

If you don't care about print debugging, you should review your coding style/routine to become more efficient.
