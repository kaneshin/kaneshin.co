## Push to master

Git is good for us to manage version of source files.

Sometimes, someone who is member of project delete or overwrite forcely master branch by mistaken.

I wouldn't like to restore branch for it.

So, our project is adopting "pre-push" script to hook when git-push.

"pre-push" is contained script below;

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while read local_ref local_sha1 remote_ref remote_sha1
do
  if [[ "${remote_ref##refs/heads/}" == "master" ]]; then
    res=""
    while [[ "${res}" != "Y" ]] && [[ "${res}" != "N" ]]; do
      echo -n "Do you want to push the master branch to remote [y/N]? "
      read -s -n 1 res < /dev/tty
      if [[ "$res" == "" ]]; then
          res="N"
      fi
      res=`echo "${res}" | tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'`
    done
    echo ""
    if [[ "${res}" == "N" ]]; then
        exit 1
    fi
  fi
done
```

Use this script if you bother mistaken git-push from others.
